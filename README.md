# Speechrecognition
Converts audio to text. Eligible for both recorded sound or sppech.
it ask you to choose a file where you want the text or else creates a file for the same.
i have used python to make this project
the code is quite simple divided into two phase
1st phase is about whether you have a recorded file oryou want to say something
then it detects the word using google api
and in 2nd phase it paste it into a file either pre existing or creates a new one
